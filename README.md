# hackathon-24-8 entry by Herberts

Feedback:
* I like the popup notifying that java changes were hot deployed. 
* Download handler
  * API versatility seems nice. 
  * When clicking Download link, the UI seems to lose connection and reconnects with an "Online" in the loader. Happens on firefox, but seems to work smoothly on chrome. Reported: https://github.com/vaadin/flow-components/issues/7549
